# Scenario C — Reporting Anomaly

**Platform:** Vorsa Observability Control Plane  
**Environment:** northvale-council  
**Scenario Type:** Business data anomaly — application logic layer  
**Severity:** WARNING  
**Health Score:** 97 → 72  
**Duration:** ~2 hours (data quality issue, not infrastructure failure)  

---

## Overview

At 08:05 UTC, the Vorsa reporting checks detected duplicate visit IDs in `statdb`
and carryover visit totals from the previous business day that had not been cleared
during the nightly reset. Infrastructure remained fully healthy — all services
running, PostgreSQL at 2.8%, HTTP responding at 228ms. This is a pure data quality
incident at the Qmatic application layer.

This scenario demonstrates the depth of Qmatic-specific operational intelligence
in Vorsa — detecting business-level anomalies that no generic infrastructure
monitoring tool would surface. The incident had no visible infrastructure signature:
no alarms, no latency, no service stops. Only a platform that understands Qmatic
data semantics could have caught it.

`⚠` = data quality issue  `✓` = healthy  

**Note:** No infrastructure nodes are degraded. The anomaly is entirely within
the data layer — statdb contains incorrect records that are being fed downstream
to the BI layer.

## Why This Matters

This scenario is operationally significant for several reasons:

1. **Invisible to infrastructure monitoring** — No generic monitoring tool (Datadog,
   Prometheus, Grafana) would detect this. Connection pools are normal, services
   are running, HTTP is fast. Only a platform that understands Qmatic data semantics
   can surface this.

2. **Real business impact** — KPI dashboards are overstating delivered visits by ~40%.
   Management reports for the day will be incorrect. Power BI / Tableau will ingest
   bad data into historical trend analysis.

3. **Compliance implications** — Northvale Council may have SLA or reporting
   obligations based on citizen service metrics. Incorrect data could affect
   contract compliance reporting.

4. **Silent corruption** — Without Vorsa, this would go undetected until someone
   noticed the inflated KPI numbers — potentially hours or days later.

## RCA Summary

The Qmatic nightly statistics reset job failed to complete at 07:00 UTC. The most
likely cause is a scheduling conflict or a long-running query that held a lock on
`statdb` during the reset window, preventing the cleanup procedure from completing.
As a result, 847 visit records from the previous business day persisted into the
new day's statistics, and 23 visit IDs were duplicated at the day boundary.

**Resolution:** Manual statdb reset executed by the Qmatic administrator at 09:45 UTC.
All duplicate records cleared and carryover counts reset to 0.

## Prevention Recommendations

1. **Monitor nightly reset completion** — Add a Vorsa check that verifies the
   statdb reset job completed by 07:30 UTC each morning.

2. **Alert on carryover detection** — The current Vorsa check fires during the
   first poll after business hours begin. Earlier detection (07:00–07:30) would
   allow correction before the business day starts.

3. **Duplicate visit ID alerting** — Set threshold at 0 (any duplicate is an
   anomaly). Current threshold is 3 — the 23 detected today could have been
   caught earlier.

4. **statdb schema mapping** — Complete the statdb schema mapping in Vorsa
   (`reporting_checks.enabled: true`) to enable full reporting anomaly detection.
